# Toll-Free SMS vs. Local Numbers

Local and toll-free numbers can be used to send and receive SMS under RingCentral's SMS program.

| Number Type | Description |
|-|-|
| Local | Local Numbers have geographically assigned area codes, e.g. `650-555-0100`. These numbers may be desirable when your firm has a local presence, e.g. texting for a physical local presence to a recipient in the same geographic area. |
| Toll-Free | Toll-Free Numbers have nation-wide area codes, e.g. `800-555-0100`. These are useful for sending nation-wide when there is no need to associate the message with a specific geographic region. Toll-free numbers have one of the following area codes: 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844 or 833. |

Both types of numbers can be purchased in the RingCentral [Account Portal](https://service.ringcentral.com) under "Phone Numbers".

### Carrier Approval

Both local and toll-free numbers can be used to send "Non-Consumer (A2P)" SMS as described in the [CTIA Messaging Principles and Best Practices guide](https://www.ctia.org/the-wireless-industry/industry-commitments/messaging-interoperability-sms-mms).

Local numbers are enrolled in a Commercial Long Code / 10DLC program with wireless carriers that allows these numbers to send at high volume.

### Supported Countries

Currently, SMS is supported for numbers in the United States and Canada.

## Ordering and Provisioning Numbers

To use SMS, you must have one or more phone numbers configured for it. RingCentral SMS-enabled phone numbers can be configured for consumer or non-consumer-A2P, and can be switched back and forth, but a number cannot be both at the same time.

If you don't have a number already, log into the [Account Portal](https://service.ringcentral.com) and navigate to the following location to purchase a new number.

["Phone System" > "All Numbers" > "+ Add Number"](https://service.ringcentral.com/application/company/phoneNumbers/allNumbers)

Once you have a number, it will be initially provisioned for Enhanced Business SMS. To configure a number for non-consumer-A2P use, enroll in the at https://gamechanging.dev/sms</a> and indicate which numbers you want to convert. After your number has been provisioned, you can verify the configuration with the steps in the next section on listing valid SMS numbers.
